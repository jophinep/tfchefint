TeamForge-Chef Integration Cookbook
===================================

Installs scripts and associated automation needed to get CollabNet TeamForge and Chef integrated.

Requirements
============

CollabNet TeamForge Server plus some nodes to deploy software to.

Workflow
========

The TeamForge and Chef integration involves a properly-configured "deployment tracker" defined within CollabNet TeamForge.

Each deployment is a tracker artifact with three important flex fields defined:

* Deploy To - The list of Chef environments understood by this Chef installation
* FRSID - The TeamForge File Release Area (FRS) item ID represented by this tracker artifact
* Application Shortname - The short name of the application, which is also the name of the data bag item stored below.

The labels for the fields can be different in the tracker, but they must match the attributes under `artifact_update_hook`.

When the tracker fields are changed and saved within TeamForge, an asynchronous hook (`artifact_update`) is called to update the new flex field data within a data bag item. The data bag items are stored under the bag name defined by `node['tfchefint']['artifact_update_hook']['app_bag_name']`.

The artifact_update hook will also then use Chef's `knife ssh` command to log into servers running the application in question, and run Chef manually. Applications managed by properly-written Chef recipes that retrieve their build artifacts from the FRS (using the teamforge_frsfile resource) will update themselves and restart appropriate services.

Attributes
==========

See `attributes/default.rb` for default values.

chefauth
--------

* `node['tfchefint']['chefauth']['sf-admin-home']` - the default install location of CollabNet TeamForge and hence the home directory of the 'sf-admin' user
* `node['tfchefint']['chefauth']['chef-server-url']` - the Chef server to contact in the asynchronous callback scripts

artifact_update_hook
--------------------

* `node['tfchefint']['artifact_update_hook']['app_bag_name']` - the data bag to store items for each app of interest that's being deployed from the Deployment Tracker
* `node['tfchefint']['artifact_update_hook']['target_env_field']` = the label for the field in the Deployment Tracker indicating the target Chef environment
* `node['tfchefint']['artifact_update_hook']['frsid_field']` = the label for the field in the Deployment Tracker indicating the FRS ID
* `node['tfchefint']['artifact_update_hook']['appname_field']` = the label for the field in the Deployment Tracker indicating the application short name

Recipes
=======

default
-------

Does nothing.

client and server
-----------------

There are two convenience recipes, 'client' and 'server', that include the relevant individual recipes to make the integration work. 'client' runs on each application server; 'server' runs on the TeamForge server itself and installs the asynchronous hook and authentication components (e.g. Chef configurations)

artifact_update_hook
--------------------

Installs the artifact update hook script, which is a template, into the asynchronous hooks directory.

chefauth
--------

Sets up the TeamForge server so that Knife, running under the 'sf-admin' (TeamForge) user ID, can authenticate to the Chef server as a client.

We assume that a user called 'sf-admin' has been created ahead of time on the Chef server, and that the 'sf-admin.pem' can be placed manually on the TeamForge server.

hooks
-----

Installs the Java-to-arbitrary-language bridge, `hooks.jar`, on the TeamForge server, so that the artifact_update Ruby script can run.

While `hooks.jar` is not officially supported by CollabNet, some directions on its design can be found on CollabNet's blog: http://blogs.collab.net/teamforge/custom-workflow-in-teamforge-a-guide-to-iaf-event-handlers

sudoers
-------

Sets up sudoers on client machines so that the 'sf-admin' user can run Chef client as root (or signal the currently-running daemon to restart).

Note: The sf-admin user needs to be able to run the commands in this recipe without requiring a TTY. You can set this up in your main sudoers file if necessary (e.g. using Opscode's sudo cookbook), or if you're running OpenSSH >= 5.9, the `RequestTTY` option can be used in the host's ssh_options to always force the creation of a TTY.

user
----

Sets up a user called `sf-admin` on client machines.
